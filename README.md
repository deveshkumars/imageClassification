This is Devesh Kumar's implementations for project 1 of the neural 
networks project 1.

My code involves the standard artifical neural network for classifying 
fashion MNIST, as well as a convolutional neural network, and a residual 
neural network that utilizes transfer learning. I also incorporate Keras 
Tuner to tune the hyperparameters.
